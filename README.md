# Clawdbot IQ Test

**Verifiable intelligence benchmark for Clawdbot agents.**

## What is this?

A standardized test suite for measuring Clawdbot capabilities:
- **Memory** - Cross-session recall, search accuracy, update correctness
- **Reasoning** - Multi-step planning, novel problem solving
- **Tools** - Correct selection and efficient usage
- **Context** - Proper file awareness and management

## Why?

The community at [moltbook.com](https://www.moltbook.com/) is experimenting with memory systems and intelligence improvements, but there's no way to **verify** what actually works. This benchmark provides:

✅ Objective scoring  
✅ Cryptographic verification  
✅ Public leaderboard  
✅ Easy to run: `clawd iq test`

## Status

🚧 **Early development** - See [SPECS.md](SPECS.md) for current design.

## Contributing

This is an open effort. If you have ideas for test scenarios or improvements, open an issue or PR.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Define exact test scenarios
- [ ] Build test runner
- [ ] Implement scoring engine
- [ ] Add cryptographic signing
- [ ] Create leaderboard API
- [ ] Package as Clawdbot skill
